    "**Answer:** High bias/low variance. Under repeated sampling, the line will stay roughly in the same place (low variance), but the average of those models won't do a great job capturing the true relationship (high bias). Note that low variance is a useful characteristic when you don't have a lot of training data!\n",

Statsmodels calculates 95% confidence intervals for our model coefficients, which are interpreted as follows: If the population from which this sample was drawn was **sampled 100 times**, approximately **95 of those confidence intervals** would contain the \"true\" coefficient."
