> Globally, we have 3 Units in DS, each building on top of skills learned previously to scaffold students' learning over the entire course.

Our lessons each have an objective, prerequisites, resources, and project-oriented content, all tying into the overall competencies focused on in each unit. Dive into the detailed spec file to read more about each lesson and [read about our curriculum](#)

See the [feedback guidelines](#) to read more about how we provide feedback to students.

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

<!--
### **Project 1**

Students start the course focusing on the basics – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is how building for the web started, and it’s an excuse to make sure they’ve got a solid grasp on important fundamentals. To wrap up Unit 1, we build a game, challenging students’ ability to create a responsive layout using HTML and CSS, and to write complex and interesting jQuery to implement game logic. We'll give them at least 3 game specs to choose from.

We'll make sure everyone's up to speed on HTML5 and has a thorough understanding of using CSS – and using it _well_. So many graduates have gotten jobs because their projects caught an employer's eye, so giving them a lot of time to get good at implementing designs and interfaces on the front end will be a huge improvement and set them up to make all of their projects that much more impressive.

  - **Goal**: Build a game, applying browser technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - **Project Time**: 3 days
  - **[Detailed Spec File](project-01.md)**

## Unit 1

Unit 1 is all about showing the humble beginnings of the web and introducing students to foundational programming concepts that we'll use for the entire rest of the course.

Since our prework a large portion of our curriculum practices programming concepts in JavaScript, in this unit, we review data types, functions, and other foundational concepts in JavaScript.

Another goal of this unit is also to get students feeling the need for HTML templates and saving data, so that they appreciate the necessity of the topics in the units to follow.

#### Week 3

##### Project Week: Project 1

Let's start out with something fun - a game!

Everyone will get a chance to be creative and work through some really tough programming challenges – since students will have already gotten their feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, they'll have to come up with another fun and interesting game for project 1.

This will be an independent project where students will build functionality that renders a game in a browser that allows two players to play at a time.

- **Goal**: Build a browser game that allows for players to take turns and visually display a winner.
- **Project Time**: 3 days
- **[Detailed Spec File](../projects/project-01.md)**

## Unit 2

By default, this unit starts with Sinatra and later, focuses on Rails. By starting with Sinatra, and slowly building up to the processes and file/folder structure used by Rails, we are able to scaffold the learning experience without overwhelming students, at first, with the Rails file structure. We try to build an understanding of the reasons that Rails arrived on the scene. We generally don't get to APIs in this unit because there are enough foundational topics to cover in OOP, MVC, data modeling, and more. This is where students get to build their first real set of full-stack applications.

#### Week 6

##### Project Week: Project 2

For the mid-course project, we build and deploy a standard, secured CRUD app. We currently cover Ruby and Rails in this unit, focusing on mastering key concepts in object-oriented programming, MVC design patterns, and relational data modeling prior to moving on to modern full-stack web development in JavaScript.

The second unit project is an individual project. We'll give students several project specs to choose from and help them scope the project appropriately, but also invite students to exercise a little more creativity.

  - **Goal**: Build a full-stack CRUD app in Rails, that interacts with a database and includes at least a few relationships between models, server-side rendering of templates, and encryption & authentication.
  - **Project Time**: 4 days
  - **[Detailed Spec File](../projects/project-02.md)**

---

## Unit 3

Unit 3 is all about APIs. We want students to be able to use them and create them, with both Ruby and JavaScript frameworks.  Because they've just spent so much time with Rails, we'll start with APIs in Rails, enough to have a solid foundation if they want to go further.  This unit is where they'll learn Node, via Express & MongoDB. Since MongoDB goes well with Express, it gives us a chance to teach about an alternative to SQL databases that are relevant to the industry; and since they're building APIs, they'll have to consume them. Throughout the unit, students won't have an understanding of any front-end frameworks, partially because until recently, these frameworks haven't really become necessary. In their learning it won't either – we'll learn them in the next unit, once they feel the pain of AJAX and templating the old-fashioned way and crave something more organized.

#### Week 9

##### Project Week: Project 3

For the third project, we have students, as a group, design and build an API in Express.

We'll give students technical requirements, the deliverables we expect, and a short list of potential project ideas, but we're looking for students to get more creative and to use Git/GitHub to work as a team.

  - **Goal**: Work collaboratively with other classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an API of your own design.
  - **Project Time**: 4 days
  - **[Detailed Spec File](../projects/project-03.md)**

## Unit 4

Unit 4, our final unit, returns to focus on the front-end looking at JavaScript frameworks. The world of JavaScript frameworks is changing rapidly. After _lots_ research, there's no clear standout in front-end frameworks right now, and there are jobs available in _all_ the frameworks. They all address similar challenges but use slightly different concepts that are worth learning.

In our public-facing syllabus, we attempt to define these topics as broadly as possible, referencing the following overarching topics:

- Introduction to Angular.js
- Extending DOM Elements with Custom Behaviors
- Client-side Models and Data Binding
- Views and Templates
- Client-side Form Validation
- Connecting and Syncing with a REST API
- Managing Authentication State

You'll notice that **Angular.js** is the only framework that we reference (briefly) in the public syllabus at the moment. In many of our markets, we are seeing students getting jobs because they know Angular. This doesn't mean it's necessarily the best framework to teach from a pedagogical perspective, but it's led us to decide to build out our core lessons and materials using Angular. It's important for everyone to have at least one overview lesson introducing Angular, even if your market decides to teach most of the topics above using one of the other frameworks.

After week 10, this unit also leaves time for a few other important topics. We'll take about a day to cover key computer science concepts that may pop up in interviews: data structures, big O notation, search algorithms, etc. We'll also leave a day for optional topics - like ES2015, background jobs, AWS hosting, etc. - and a couple days for review-focused codealongs.

#### Week 12

##### Project Week: Project 4

For the fourth project, students are to build a full-stack application using their own front- and back-end.

The final project expects students to practice everything we've taught them over the course of 11 weeks: APIs, Git/GitHub, user stories and wireframing, and writing documentation. As always, we'll give students technical requirements and the deliverables we expect, but students are responsible for putting together a reasonable project proposal to build a full-stack application that's visually appealing.

  - **Goal**: Build a full-stack application
  - **Project Time**: 4 days
  - **[Detailed Spec File](../project-04.md)** -->
