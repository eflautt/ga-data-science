> _Every student should have a chance to understand how they're doing and to get valuable feedback on the work they've done from trusted mentors like us._

Our goal is to provide meaningful suggestions and personal guidance to all of our students. While there will undoubtedly be nuances in how each of us evaluates student portfolio projects, using these guidelines will ensure that students get the personalized feedback they deserve.

## Guiding Principles

- Prompts and rubrics are provided to **structure feedback for student projects**.
- Rubrics are based on a **simple 3-point scale**, tailored for each project.
- Metrics for "meets expectations" are clearly defined to help you provide **targeted feedback.**

## Feedback Rules

- Students should be shown a copy of the blank rubric when given their project prompt
- Rubric categories and evaluation metrics should always be tied to project specifications.
