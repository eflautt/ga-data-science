### PROMPT
**Context & Takeaway:**

In this project, you will perform a logistic regression on the admissions data we've been working with in projects 1 and 2. For more instructions, follow the questions included in the starter code.

**Goal:** Completed iPython notebook that includes basic modeling using logistic regression

### DELIVERABLES
**Project Requirements & Constraints**

- **Breakdown:**
    - Create dummy variables
    - Calculate OR by hand
    - Complete a logistic regression using stats models and interpret your findings
    - Calculate predicted probabilities

- **Submission:**
    - TBD by Instructor

- **Bonus:** 
    - Plot the predicted portabilities
    - Brainstorm ways to improve your analysis


### TIMELINE
**Deadlines & Due Dates**

### EVALUATION
**Guidelines & Rubric** 

Your project will be evaluated by your instructors in the following areas:

1. Mine
2. Refine
3. Build

#### Rubric: [Link to rubric](#). 

Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of 9 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While the overall rubric will serve as a helpful gauge of whether you met project goals, your __specific scores are more important__ since they can help you identify where to focus your efforts in the future!

### RESOURCES
**Examples & Suggestions**

#### Dataset  
We'll be using the same dataset as UCLA's Logit Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python. Our goal will be to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school. It contains four variables- admit, gre, gpa, rank.

- 'admit' is a binary variable. It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted admit =1) our not (admit= 0)
- 'gre' is GRE score
- 'gpa' stands for Grade Point Average
- 'rank' is the rank of an applicant's undergraduate alma mater, with 1 being the highest and 4 as the lowest

Dataset: [admissions.csv](assets/admissions.csv)

#### Starter code
Review the questions in the iPython Notebook provided.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started
- Review logistic regression, odds ratios and probabilities from lecture
- **Read the docs for Stats models.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a data scientist!
