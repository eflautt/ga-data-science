### PROMPT
**Context & Takeaway:**
In this project, you will summarize and present your analysis from Projects 1-3. Your goal is to complete your ongoing iPython Notebook, combining prior deliverables from projects 1-3 with an appendix and executive summary. This will be a final overview of your analysis that incorporates past feedback and demonstrates your approach.

**Goal:** Write up an executive summary that outlines your findings and the methods used in projects 1-3.

### DELIVERABLES
**Project Requirements & Constraints**

#### iPython Notebook with Executive Summary
- **Breakdown:**
    -  “Specific aim”
    -  Outlined methods and models 
    -  Articulation of datasets 
    -  Risks and assumptions 
    -  Goals and criteria for success
    -  A exploratory data analysis overview with visualizations and statistical analysis 
    -  A writeup on the interpretation of findings including an executive summary with conclusions and next steps 

- **Submission:**	
    - TBD by instructor. 

- **Bonus:** 
    - Always consider your audience - what do they already know vs. what should you define or explain?
    - Visualize your findings! Use charts, graphs, or other images as appropriate.

### TIMELINE
**Deadlines & Due Dates**

### EVALUATION
**Guidelines & Rubric** 

Your project will be evaluated by your instructors in the following areas:

1. Refine
2. Build
3. Present

#### Rubric: [Link to rubric](#). 

Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of 9 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While the overall rubric will serve as a helpful gauge of whether you met project goals, your __specific scores are more important__ since they can help you identify where to focus your efforts in the future!

### RESOURCES
**Examples & Suggestions**

#### Dataset  
We'll be using the same dataset as UCLA's Logit Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python. Our goal will be to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school. It containes four variables- admit, gre, gpa, rank.

- 'admit' is a binary variable. It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted admit =1) our not (admit= 0)
- 'gre' is GRE score
- 'gpa' stands for Grade Point Average
- 'rank' is the rank of an applicant's undergraduate alma mater, with 1 being the highest and 4 as the lowest

#### Starter code
An iPython Notebook with guiding questions is provided.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started
- Review your previous  notebooks and any intructor feedback.
- Look up sample executive summaries online.
